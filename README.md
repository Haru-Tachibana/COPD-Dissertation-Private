# Research Objectives

## Examine Healthcare Access:
Assess the availability and accessibility of healthcare resources in South Dakota's rural counties and their impact on COPD management during the COVID-19 pandemic.
## Analyse Air Quality: 
Investigate the correlation between air quality indices (e.g., PM2.5, ozone levels) and COPD prevalence rates in South Dakota from 2018 to 2021.
## Assess Spatial Variation: 
Map the spatial distribution of COPD prevalence across South Dakota counties over the study period to identify areas of concern and potential hotspots.
## Evaluate Trends: 
Analyse the trends in COPD prevalence and air quality data over time, focusing on the worsening trends observed in South Dakota.
## Public Health Implications: 
Provide insights into how limited healthcare access and local air quality contribute to COPD rates, informing public health policies and strategies for prevention and management.
## Integrate Machine Learning: 
Employ machine learning techniques to predict COPD prevalence based on air quality and healthcare access data, enhancing the understanding of these relationships.
