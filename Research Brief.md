# Impact of Rural Healthcare Access and Air Quality on COPD Prevalence in South Dakota During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Localised Spatial Analysis


## Research Brief

### Background

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) poses a significant public health challenge, particularly in rural areas like South Dakota, where healthcare resources may be limited. The prevalence of COPD has been exacerbated by environmental factors such as air quality, which directly influences respiratory health. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these challenges have intensified, raising critical questions about healthcare access and management for chronic conditions.

South Dakota is predominantly rural, with approximately 61% of its population residing in rural areas. This rural character presents unique healthcare challenges, including fewer healthcare facilities, longer travel distances to medical services, and a shortage of healthcare professionals. The state experienced one of the highest COVID-19 infection rates in the country during the pandemic, further straining its healthcare system and complicating the management of vchronic diseases like COPD.

### Rationale for Focusing on South Dakota

While many states observed declining COPD prevalence trends from 2018 to 2021, South Dakota exhibited an unusual increase, with four of the top ten counties showing worsening trends in COPD rates. This anomaly raises concerns about the local environmental influences, including air quality, and the role of healthcare access during the pandemic. By focusing on South Dakota, this research aims to investigate how rural healthcare access and air quality interact to affect COPD prevalence, especially in the wake of COVID-19.

### Research Gap

Despite extensive studies linking air quality to respiratory diseases, there is limited research examining the compounded effects of rural healthcare access and air quality on COPD prevalence during the pandemic in South Dakota. The spatial variations in COPD rates across the state and the influence of healthcare challenges during COVID-19 are underexplored areas that warrant investigation.

### Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are as follows:

1. **Examine Healthcare Access**: Assess the availability and accessibility of healthcare resources in South Dakota's rural counties and their impact on COPD management during the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. **Analyse Air Quality**: Investigate the correlation between air quality indices (e.g., PM2.5, ozone levels) and COPD prevalence rates in South Dakota from 2018 to 2021.

3. **Assess Spatial Variation**: Map the spatial distribution of COPD prevalence across South Dakota counties over the study period to identify areas of concern and potential hotspots.

4. **Evaluate Trends**: Analyse the trends in COPD prevalence and air quality data over time, focusing on the worsening trends observed in South Dakota.

5. **Public Health Implications**: Provide insights into how limited healthcare access and local air quality contribute to COPD rates, informing public health policies and strategies for prevention and management.

6. **Integrate Machine Learning**: Employ machine learning techniques to predict COPD prevalence based on air quality and healthcare access data, enhancing the understanding of these relationships.

### Conclusion

By addressing these objectives, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between rural healthcare access, air quality, and COPD prevalence in South Dakota during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings could inform targeted public health interventions and contribute to the broader understanding of environmental health impacts on chronic diseases.
